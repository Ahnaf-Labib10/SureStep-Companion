# SureStep-Companion
The cane is equipped with two ultrasonic sensors, one at the bottom and the other at the
middle, and a headphone. The bottom one measures the distance and alerts the user if there is
a slope or by sending a command to the user through the headphone using text-to-speech. The
middle one also does the same and alerts the user if there is a wall in front by sending
commands through the headphone again. The cane is also equipped with a thermal sensor and
a vibrator module. The thermal sensor detects heat of an object so for example if a person is
walking in front of the user, it will alert the user by using the vibration that there is a person
ahead. The cane is equipped with two different alert sensors so the user does not get confused,
which is for measuring distance from a wall and which is for checking if someone is in front of
the user.
